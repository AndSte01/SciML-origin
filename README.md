# Course Materials to *Scientific Machine Learning for Engineers* WS22-23

All lecture and exercise materials related to this course will be uploaded here.

## Exercise Setup

The easiest way to run the exercise notebooks is through [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

If you want to run them locally, we provide this setup tested on Ubuntu 20.04 with CUDA 11.6:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
